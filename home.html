  Sly and the Family Stone are one of the most influential bands to come out of 1960s America. Along with The Meters and James Brown, they brought funk to the masses.
<br><br>
  The brainchild of San Francisco DJ Sylvester "Sly" Stone, using his considerable prowess as a producer, singer and songwriter, he put together a multi-racial group releasing numerous hit singles throughout that decade and the next. 
  <br><br>
  The music reflected the concerns of the era, capturing the hope, optimism and counter-culture of the Summer of Love; nevertheless this was also the time the Civil Rights movement was taking off, and here was a band who addressed serious social and political issues.
  <br><br>
  From a musical perspective, their diverse style showcased influences from psychedelia, children's nursery rhymes and music hall; all the while steeped in blues and soul. The bass player - Larry Graham - is the very person who invented the famously percussive "slap bass" style. 
  <br><br>
  Does it get any funkier than that?
